This data visualisation was created as part of the #DuBoisChallenge2022.

William Edward Burghardt „W. E. B.“ Du Bois was an American sociologist and Pan-Afrikanist human rights activist. He created a series of hand-drawn data visualisations (referred to as 'plates') for the 1900 world exhibition in Paris. Many of them are concerned with racism and the lives of African Americans at the turn of the century, and in addition, they are visually highly interesting. 
The goal of the challenge is to re-create DuBois' visualisationsof your choice using modern tools. 

The data are provided by Anthony Starks who started the challenge. More details can be found here: https://nightingaledvs.com/the-dubois-challenge/

I chose to recreate the Illiteracy plate, thinking it would be fun and easy (I like bar plots!), but it turns out there was much more to this simple-looking visualisation – like inverting x and y axis or drawing polygons. I have never used ggplot2 this way, you really need to tweak it in ways you never would for a 'conventional' data visualisation. It was super interesting, challening and fun to figure out.

My recreation is not a 100% faithful copy of the original. But it comes close enough to bring me a little joy :octopus:
