In this repository you find my contributions to TidyTuesday.

Tidy Tuesday is a weekly event by the R4DS Online Learning Community (R4DS = R  for Data Science, a very popular learning resrource for R).
Every week a raw dataset is posted, along with a chart or article related to that dataset. The task is to explore the data and create a visualisation of an aspect of the data you find interesting.
While the dataset will be “tamed”, it is not always be tidy. As such, various data cleaning and wrangling techniques might be necessary to bring the data into the desired format.

The goal of TidyTuesday is to apply and extend R skills, get feedback, explore other’s work, and connect with the #RStats community!

People of all skill levels are invited to participate, as the best way to improve your code is... ✨coding!
